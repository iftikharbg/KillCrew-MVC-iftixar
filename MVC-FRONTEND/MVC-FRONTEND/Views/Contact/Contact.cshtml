            <h3>Where’s my package:</h3>
            <p>
                It's challenging running a small brand right now and things are a bit backed up on our end. Due to
                social distancing we only have 1 person in the warehouse right now to process, pack and ship orders.
                Rest assured, we’re working hard to deliver your order as soon as possible, while caring for the
                health and safety of our small crew. We expect most orders to ship in 1-3 weeks. Your tracking link
                will update as soon as your package is picked up by USPS. Don't worry you didn't make a mistake, we
                have your order, and we're taking care of it as fast as we can. Thanks again for having patience
                with us during these times and supporting our brand.
            </p>

            <p>
                Did you place the order with a different email than your primary? Did you check your spam folder?
                Maybe you fat fingered it and misspelled it. If you still can't find it, please email us at
                hello@killcrew.co with (Order #, No Confirmation Email) please allow our team 2-4 business days to
                respond.

            <h3>Tracking number says my package was delivered?</h3>
            <p>
                It happens sometimes, if your tracking information shows “delivered” to your address but you never
                received your package, we ask for you file a “lost” package claim with USPS or UPS:
